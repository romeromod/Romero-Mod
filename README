Romero Mod
"A more gritty, realistic zombie experience."

1. What is it?

Romero Mod is a total conversion mod for Left 4 Dead 2, inspired by George A. Romero's masterpiece zombie films.

The mod has the following goals:
	* Evoke a feeling of genuine dread
	* Improve game world immersion
	* Dramatically change the strategies required to win
	* Create something fun!


2. How to install / use

It is recommended that you disable all other L4D2 add-ons when using the Romero Mod.  Conflicts will almost certainly occur when other mods are present!

Place the romeromod.vpk in the following folder (your path may vary slightly, depending on install location):
	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead 2\left4dead2\addons"

Launch L4D2, and enjoy!


3. Credits / Legal

Romero Mod has no affiliation with George A. Romero, his estate, his production companies, or any of his films.  Romero Mod is a wholly original work, intended to be an homage of sorts to his creative vision.

Special thanks goes to the "Weapon Realism" mod ( http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=13260 ) by TheHyena & DJK83 for serving as a starting point for the weapon attributes.

Also, special thanks goes to the "hide hud(G.U.I/UI)" mod ( http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=14493 ) by zippa for serving as a starting point for the GUI tweaks.
